# BlockID

## 🧠 Project Description
**BlockID** is a decentralized identity management system built on Ethereum.  
It empowers users to create, own, and manage their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities.  
The system ensures secure registration, verification, and retrieval of user identities using blockchain technology.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a **trustless, user-centric identity ecosystem** where individuals have full control over their personal information — enabling a future where identity is secure, portable, and verifiable anywhere on the blockchain.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Identity Registration:** Users can register their unique identity on-chain.  
- **Verification System:** Only the contract owner (admin) can verify user identities.  
- **Self-Service Updates:** Users can update their information securely.  
- **Public Identity Retrieval:** Anyone can fetch verified user data.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized KYC and on-chain credentials.  
- Multi-signature identity verification.  
- Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based privacy layer.  
- Cross-chain identity interoperability using Layer 2 or DID standards.  
- Front-end dApp for user interaction.
